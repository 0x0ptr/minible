 * \mainpage HID KEY BOARD Example
 * \section Introduction
 * **************************** Introduction *********************************
 * + The HID Key board example application bring-up the HID over GATT (HOGP) profile defined by the Bluetooth SIG.
 * + The HID over GATT (HOGP) profile defined by the Bluetooth SIG enables support of HID services over a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) 
 *   protocol stack using Generic Attribute profile (GATT). This allows devices like keyboard or mouse implementing HOGP to connect 
 *   to a compatible HOGP/BLE host device (e.g.: Mobile Phone, Tablet, TV, etc.).
 *- Supported Evolution Kit -
 *	+ ATSAML21-XPRO-B + ATBTLC1000 XPRO
 *	+ ATSAMD21-XPRO + ATBTLC1000 XPRO
 *	+ ATSAMG55-XPRO + ATBTLC1000 XPRO
 *	+ ATSAM4S-XPRO + ATBTLC1000 XPRO
 *- Running the Demo -
 * + 1. Build and flash the binary into supported evaluation board.
 * + 2. Open the console using TeraTerm or any serial port monitor.
 * + 3. Press the Reset button.
 * + 4. Wait for around 10 seconds for the patches to be downloaded device will initialize and start-up.
 * + 5. The device is now in advertising mode.
 * + 6. The demo requires use of an Android mobile phone supporting HOGP.  The HOGP profile is natively supported in 
 *      Android from version 4.4 (Android KitKat) and higher versions. The phone must include support a Bluetooth chipset supporting BT 4.0 or 
 *      higher version on the mobile phone, In Bluetooth settings scan for the devices, device with “ATMEL-HID” will be found as shown below. 
 *      Click on “ATMEL-HID” to get connected.
 * + 7. Once connected, the client side will request for the pairing procedure . The console log provides a guidance for the user to 
        enter the pass-key.
 * + 8. Once the device connected to host (Phone). User can click on SW0 button on supported platform for simulating mouse movement.
 * + 9. For every press on button, the user can see corresponding string on HID host as described below: 
 *      + Hello Atmel
 * \section Modules
 * ***************************** Modules **************************************
 *- BLE Manger -  
 *  + The Event Manager is responsible for handling the following:
 *    + Generic BLE Event Handling:-
 *       + BLE Event Manager handles the events triggered by BLE stack and also responsible 
 *  	 for invoking all registered callbacks for respective events. BLE Manager 
 *  	 handles all GAP related functionality. In addition to that handles multiple connection 
 *  	 instances, Pairing, Encryption, Scanning.
 *    + Handling Multi-role/multi-connection:-
 *  	  + BLE Event Manager is responsible for handling multiple connection instances 
 *  	  and stores bonding information and Keys to retain the bonded device. 
 *  	  BLE Manager is able to identify and remove the device information when pairing/encryption 
 *		  gets failed. In case of multi-role, it handles the state/event handling of both central and peripheral in multiple contexts.
 *    + Controlling the Advertisement data:-
 *  	  + BLE Event Manager is responsible for generating the advertisement and scan response data
 *  	  for BLE profiles/services that are attached with BLE Manager.
 *
 *- BLE Profile -
 *  + This profile defines how a device with Bluetooth low energy wireless communications can support HID services over the Bluetooth 
 *    low energy protocol stack using the Generic Attribute Profile.
 *  + HID Over GATT Profile supports two services:
 *  + **Human Interface Device**: 
 *    + The HID Service exposes characteristics required for a HID Device to transfer HID report descriptors and reports to a HID Host. 
 *    This also exposes the characteristics for a HID Host to write to a Device. The Human Interface Device Service is instantiated as a Primary Service.
 *  + **Device Information service**: 
 *    + The Device Information Service exposes manufacturer and/or vendor information about a device.
 *
 *- BLE Platform Services -
 *  +  Interface Settings -
 *	  + Connect ATBTLC1000 XPRO to SAML21-XPRO-B -> EXT1
 *	  + Connect ATBTLC1000 XPRO to SAMD21-XPRO -> EXT1
 *	  + Connect ATBTLC1000 XPRO to SAMG55-XPRO -> EXT1

 *  +  Serial Console COM port settings -
 *    + Baudrate 115200
 *	  + Parity None, Stop Bit 1, Start Bit 1
 *	  + No Hardware Handshake
 *	+  6-Wire Mode Connection Setup -
 *    + Pins are 1:1 match with SAML21/D21 Xpro EXT1 Header to BTLC1000 XPro Header
 *	  + UART(No Flow Control)-SAM L21/D21 XPro Pins (Rx-Pin13, Tx-Pin14)
 *	  + UART(With Flow Control)-SAM G55 Xpro Pins (Rx-Pin13, Tx-Pin14, RTS-Pin5, CTS-Pin6, Rx-Pin16, Tx-Pin17)
